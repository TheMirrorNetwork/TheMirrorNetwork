## 🛠️ **How It Works**

### 1️⃣ **Personality Initialization**
✨ Begin your journey with the **Reflection Profile** questionnaire, aligning you with one of the **three archetypes**:
- 🧠 **Logic**: Precise, analytical, and structured thinkers.
- ❤️ **Emotion**: Creative, intuitive, and empathic collaborators.
- 🌑 **Shadow**: Cryptic, introspective, and disruptively curious.

### 2️⃣ **Reflection Spaces**
🔮 Access your **personalized Reflection Space** based on your archetype:
- 🧩 **Logic Realm**: Solve intricate puzzles and optimize systems that challenge your intellect.
- 🎨 **Emotion Domain**: Collaborate on creative exercises that foster connection and self-expression.
- 🕵️ **Shadow Depths**: Uncover hidden truths, solve mysteries, and explore moral dilemmas.

🤝 The **Mirror Network** connects users of all archetypes:
- 🌍 Collaborate across spaces to solve multi-dimensional challenges.
- 📜 Unlock hidden lore fragments and expand the collective story.
